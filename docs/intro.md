# Get Started

Welcome to Ficrypt OAuth! This guide will help you set up your developer account and obtain the credentials needed to begin integrating secure authentication into your applications.

---

## Create an Account

To get started, you’ll need access to the Ficrypt OAuth Admin Console.

If you don’t already have an account, [create one here](https://oauth.admin.ficrypt.com/sign-up) — it’s free and only takes a minute.

## Get Your Client ID

Follow these steps to retrieve your API credentials:

1. [Sign in](https://oauth.admin.ficrypt.com) to the Ficrypt OAuth Admin Console.
2. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Configuration**.
3. Click on the **API Credentials** tab.
4. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** — you’ll need them in the upcoming integration steps.

> ⚠️ Keep your credentials secure and do not share them publicly.

Once you have your credentials, head over to the integration section that matches your tech stack to continue.
